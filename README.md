# GameManager
Game Manager for now is responsible for Loot, Invertory System and Experience System, Spawning System is included too but it is primitive and time by time will update it to make more complex and being mroe advanced

*Experience System: its simple script responsible for adding exp points to the player once the monster dies
*Loot: which is scriptable object script scrpit which is responsible to handle the drops preferences like its dropping percentage (AKA rarity), defining its type (like: consumble, weapon or upgrade item, etc) and how much size its takes from the total inverotry stack.

*Invertory System: the script that handle how many items the player can handle (soon will will include a function so that you have the ability to upgrade the bag).
*Spawning System: for now its only for spawning the objects around the map and yet not for spawning monsters (but will try to make more advanced as much as I can).
